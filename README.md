# SearchSource
A text file scanner

Like a lot of developers, I've amassed a large collection of source code files over the years.  So, when I want to find something I've done before, it's hard to remember where it is.  This program will scan from it's location down through all subdirectories looking in common pro gramming files for your search terms, and present you a list of it's findings.  Specific file types that it searches can be found in the source.  And, of course, you can add more if you want to include files such as Python .py files.
